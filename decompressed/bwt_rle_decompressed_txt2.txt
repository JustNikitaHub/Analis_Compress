With all my sleeplessness I love you,
With all my sleeplessness I listen to you—
At that hour when all over the Kremlin
The bell-ringers awake.
But my river—yes, with your river,
But my hand—yes, with your hand
Will not join. My joy, how long
Before dawn overtakes—the dawn?
Snow falls, snow falls,
Snow falls, and all is in turmoil:
The whitened pedestrian,
The astonished plants,
The turn of the crossroads.
Don’t sleep, don’t sleep, work,
Do not interrupt your labor,
Don’t sleep, fight off drowsiness,
Like a pilot, like a star.
And the moneychanger answered me briefly:
Of love, we do not speak in words,
Of love, we only sigh in secret,
Yet our eyes, like sapphires, burn.
Rain falls, rain falls,
Rain taps on my window pane.
Rain sings, rain sings,
As if it knows: I’m alone again.
Day by day, day by day —
Clouds, puddles, endless gray.
I call, I call,
But no one hears, no one at all.
Wait, wait, wait without end,
Wait till waiting breaks you down.
Heart beats, heart beats,
But it can’t wait any more now.
Poems are not just words arranged in rhyme. This is a compressed universe where every line is a sigh and every word is a pulse. In prose, you can wander along the roads of descriptions for a long time, but poetry is lightning: it blinds you immediately and forever.
Why are some poems remembered the first time, while others, even beautiful ones, are forgotten as soon as you turn the page? It's about repetitions — not only sound ones, but also semantic ones. "I love you, I love you while I'm breathing" is not just a rhythm, but an insistence of feeling. Repetition is a spell. He drives a thought into consciousness like a nail into a tree.
But poetry is not only about passion. Sometimes their strength lies in the understatement. And it happens that poems break the language in order to say something that cannot be expressed otherwise. Poetry is a language in its purest form, without excess. They can do without a plot, but not without a rhythm. They can abandon rhyme, but not from repetition. Because repetition is the heartbeat of a verse. Without him, the poem crumbles like sand through your fingers. And if you ask why poetry is needed at all in a world where there is prose, the answer is simple: so that feelings do not blur, but hit one point. Like a hammer on a nail. Like a drop sharpening a stone. Over and over again. Until there's a trace left.
Poems breathe. And breathing is always a repetition: inhale-exhale, inhale-exhale. A rhythm that you can't give up, even if you really want to. If you hold your breath, the verse turns into a scream. And a scream is no longer poetry, it's torn air. Repetition in poetry is not laziness, it is not a poverty of language. This is hypnosis.
But what if there are no repeats? Then the verse becomes as flat as paper. Even the verliebre, even the "free verse" – if it is alive – clings to internal repetitions. Sound effects. Semantic. Tactile.
Because poetry is not just a text. It's a spell frozen between "was" and "will be." And for it to work, you need to repeat it over and over again.
Like a name. Like a prayer. Like the last word you say before the world turns upside down.
